# SWATModeling
Provide an introduction of Soil Water Assessment and Tool Modeling

# CrossSectionsExtractionVisualization (CSEV)
The cross-section extraction visualization tool automates extracting cross-sections with their horizontal distance and elevation. The repository contains notebooks and ArcGIS Pro Tool for cross-section extraction and visualization.

## Usage Guide
The easiest and quickest way to use the cross-section extraction visualization tool is to run it from ArcPro Toolboxes, where the functions can be directly loaded without setup. The tutorial for using the tool is shared on my YouTube channel (learnsomethingtoday): https://youtu.be/J0KKxBf-vLI

Currently, it provides CSVs and PNG files further extension is available in the GitHub repository with the folder name of CrossSectionsExtractionVisualizationExtension which tool tries to convert point to line which has shapefile (.shp), raster (.tif) and save it in the ArcGIS Pro content.
